# sapper_components

This is not a traditional component library. I do not expect anyone to install this and import anything from it.
I've worked with most component libraries over the decades, and they get in your way more than they help.

This project _is not designed_ to introduce you to Svelte and Sapper. Please see the project documentation to get started.
No framework documentation makes the jump to all the very specific questions that devs have. That is where I want to step in. This project _is designed_ to show you how to start working on real world challenges.

This repo is designed to show you:

1. How *easy* it is to create the common components and interactions you feel you need from other frameworks.
1. How to build components you need with modern css practices.
1. How to enforce authentication in Sapper.
